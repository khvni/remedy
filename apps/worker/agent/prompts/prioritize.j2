Guidance:
- Prioritize HIGH/CRITICAL severity, easily exploitable issues, and findings with straightforward remediation.
- Prefer issues in first-party application code over vendor or generated files.
- Provide concise justifications to explain your ordering.

Input findings:
{{ findings }}

Return strictly valid JSON with this shape:
{
  "ordered_findings": [
    {
      "finding_id": "<finding_id from the input>",
      "summary": "short title of the issue",
      "justification": "one sentence why it is prioritized",
      "fix_strategy": "one sentence describing the remediation approach"
    }
