# Remedy

Remedy is a Python-first, AI-augmented security remediation service. It runs SAST and SCA scanners on GitHub repositories, prioritises findings with Gemini, synthesises minimal patches, and opens pull requests via a GitHub App integration. This repository contains the FastAPI backend, RQ worker, scanner integrations, and a lightweight React dashboard for demoing the end-to-end flow.

## Architecture Overview

Remedy follows a service + worker model:

- **FastAPI (`apps/api`)** exposes REST endpoints for repositories, scans, findings, PRs, and GitHub webhooks. It persists state in Postgres via SQLAlchemy models and enqueues work on Redis/RQ.
- **Worker (`apps/worker`)** executes queued jobs. Each job clones the target repo, runs Semgrep and dependency scanners (OSV, Syft, Grype), calls Gemini for prioritisation and patch planning, applies guarded edits, commits to a topic branch, and (optionally) pushes + opens a PR through the GitHub App credentials.
- **React dashboard (`apps/web`)** presents a single-page UI that lists repos, scans, findings, and Remedy-authored PRs by consuming the API endpoints.
- **Scanners (`scanners/`)** holds the Semgrep profiles/rules and configuration placeholders for OSV and Grype. These can be customised per deployment.
- **Infrastructure (`infra/`)** offers Dockerfiles, a Docker Compose stack for local development, and Alembic migrations.

### Data Flow

1. A repository is registered via `POST /repos` or a GitHub webhook (`/webhooks/github`).
2. `POST /scans` (or webhook) enqueues `apps.worker.tasks.run_scan` with the repo & scan kind.
3. The worker clones the repo to a temp dir, runs Semgrep (SAST) and OSV/Syft/Grype (SCA), and stores raw findings.
4. Findings are enriched with IDs and passed to the Gemini prompts for prioritisation + patch planning.
5. Generated edits are applied via `patch_apply`, committed, and pushed using GitHub App credentials; a PR is opened if the push succeeds.
6. Scan, finding, and PR metadata is persisted to Postgres for API and UI consumption.

Refer to the README within each directory for architecture, testing, and deployment notes specific to that component.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (API + worker)
- Node 20 (React dashboard)
- Docker + Docker Compose (optional but simplifies local provisioning)
- External binaries (installed on worker hosts or baked into the image): `git`, `semgrep`, `osv-scanner`, `syft`, `grype`
- Gemini API key with access to `gemini-2.5-pro`
- GitHub App configured with the permissions noted below

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` at the repository root (see `.env.example`) including:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/remedy
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
GITHUB_APP_ID=...
GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=...
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=... # base64-encoded PEM
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Remedy Bot
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=remedy@example.com
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

For the React app, `apps/web/.env` can override `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

### GitHub App Credentials

Grant the GitHub App `Contents: Read & write`, `Pull requests: Read & write`, and `Metadata: Read` permissions. After installing it on the target repo/org, capture:

- **App ID** from Developer Settings â†’ GitHub Apps
- **Installation ID** from the installation URL (`.../installations/<id>`)
- **Private key**: download the PEM, encode it with `base64 -w0 app.pem`
- **Webhook secret**: set the same value in the App configuration and `.env`

Remedy will generate a JWT, fetch an installation access token, push branches via HTTPS (`x-access-token:<token>`) and open PRs through the GitHub REST API.

## Local Development

### Option A: Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make up            # starts api, worker, db, redis, web
make migrate       # apply Alembic migrations
```

The API becomes available at `http://localhost:8002`, the dashboard at `http://localhost:5175`.

### Option B: Native

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[test]
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload
# separate shell
python apps/worker/worker.py

cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

If you want GitHub webhooks while developing locally, run `ngrok http 8000` and configure the GitHub App webhook URL as `https://<ngrok-host>/webhooks/github`.

## Testing

The repository ships with pytest-based unit and integration coverage. Execute:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
python3 -m pytest
```

The tests stand up an in-memory SQLite database, replace the Redis queue with a stub, and monkeypatch the worker pipeline to avoid network calls. They validate API CRUD responses, worker persistence, and the scan-to-PR happy path.

## Deployment Considerations

- **Database**: use managed Postgres or provision your own. Run Alembic migrations at deploy time (`make migrate`).
- **Redis**: required for RQ workers. Configure `REDIS_URL` accordingly.
- **Scanners**: ensure binaries exist in the worker runtime. Consider container images with the CLI tools pre-installed.
- **Secrets**: store `GEMINI_API_KEY`, GitHub credentials, and webhook secret in your secret manager (AWS SSM, Vault, etc.).
- **Webhooks**: expose `/webhooks/github` over HTTPS (TLS termination via load balancer/ingress). The handler validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- **Scaling**: run multiple RQ workers for throughput; add observability (logs/metrics) and timeouts around scanner execution.
- **Security**: sandbox scanner execution if possible (containers with limited permissions), and audit generated patches before pushing to production repos.

## Testing & Demo Guide

### Quick Start Testing

1. **Ensure environment is configured:**
   ```bash
   # Check .env contains valid credentials
   cat .env | grep -E "(GITHUB_APP_ID|GEMINI_API_KEY|DATABASE_URL|REDIS_URL)"
   ```

2. **Start the full stack:**
   ```bash
   make up            # starts api, worker, db, redis, web
   make migrate       # apply Alembic migrations
   ```

3. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   # Check API health
   curl http://localhost:8002/health
   # Should return: {"ok":true}
   
   # Check web dashboard
   open http://localhost:5175
   ```

### Testing with Your Repository

#### Option 1: Web Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Open the dashboard:** `http://localhost:5175`
2. **Register your repository:**
   - Click "Add Repository"
   - Enter: `https://github.com/khvni/juice-shop`
   - Click "Register"
3. **Trigger a scan:**
   - Find your repository in the list
   - Click "Scan" button
   - Select scan types: "SAST" (Semgrep) and "SCA" (OSV + Grype)
   - Click "Start Scan"
4. **Monitor progress:**
   - Watch the "Scans" tab for status updates
   - Check "Findings" tab for discovered vulnerabilities
   - Look for "Pull Requests" tab for auto-generated fixes

#### Option 2: API Direct Testing

1. **Register repository:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/repos \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://github.com/khvni/juice-shop"}'
   ```

2. **Trigger scan:**
   ```bash
   # Get the repo_id from the response above
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/scans \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"repo_id": "REPO_ID_HERE", "kinds": ["sast", "sca"]}'
   ```

3. **Check results:**
   ```bash
   # List scans
   curl http://localhost:8002/scans?repo_id=REPO_ID_HERE
   
   # List findings
   curl http://localhost:8002/findings?repo_id=REPO_ID_HERE
   
   # List PRs
   curl http://localhost:8002/prs?repo_id=REPO_ID_HERE
   ```

#### Option 3: CLI Testing (Quick Scan)

```bash
# Quick scan without full stack
python cli/remedy.py scan https://github.com/khvni/juice-shop
```

### What to Expect

#### SAST Scan (Semgrep)
- **Finds:** Code vulnerabilities, security anti-patterns, hardcoded secrets
- **Example findings:** SQL injection, XSS, insecure random, hardcoded passwords
- **Time:** 1-3 minutes depending on repo size

#### SCA Scan (OSV + Grype)
- **Finds:** Vulnerable dependencies, outdated packages, known CVEs
- **Example findings:** CVE-2023-1234 in express@4.17.1, vulnerable lodash version
- **Time:** 2-5 minutes depending on dependency count

#### AI Processing (Gemini)
- **Prioritizes:** Findings by severity and exploitability
- **Plans:** Minimal patches to fix vulnerabilities
- **Creates:** Pull requests with automated fixes

### Monitoring & Debugging

#### Check Worker Logs
```bash
# View worker container logs
docker compose -f infra/compose.yaml logs -f worker

# Look for:
# - "Worker started" - worker is running
# - "Running Semgrep..." - SAST scan started
# - "Running OSV..." - SCA scan started
# - "Creating branch..." - PR creation started
```

#### Check API Logs
```bash
# View API container logs
docker compose -f infra/compose.yaml logs -f api

# Look for:
# - "Repository registered" - repo added successfully
# - "Scan queued" - scan job created
# - "Findings stored" - results saved
```

#### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Repository not found" error:**
   - Ensure the GitHub App is installed on the target repository
   - Check `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` in `.env`

2. **"Scanner not found" error:**
   - Verify scanner binaries are installed in the worker container
   - Check worker logs for missing dependencies

3. **"Gemini API error":**
   - Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and has quota
   - Check API logs for authentication errors

4. **"Database connection failed":**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose -f infra/compose.yaml ps`
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`

5. **"Redis connection failed":**
   - Ensure Redis is running: `docker compose -f infra/compose.yaml ps`
   - Check `REDIS_URL` in `.env`

### Expected Results for Juice Shop

The OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately vulnerable application, so you should see:

#### SAST Findings (Semgrep):
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure random number generation
- Hardcoded secrets
- Authentication bypasses

#### SCA Findings (OSV + Grype):
- Vulnerable npm packages
- Outdated dependencies
- Known CVEs in dependencies

#### AI-Generated Fixes:
- Patches for SQL injection (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (input sanitization)
- Secure random number generation
- Dependency updates

### Performance Expectations

- **Small repo (< 100 files):** 2-5 minutes total
- **Medium repo (100-1000 files):** 5-15 minutes total
- **Large repo (> 1000 files):** 15-30 minutes total

### Next Steps After Testing

1. **Review findings** in the dashboard
2. **Check generated PRs** in your GitHub repository
3. **Test the fixes** by reviewing the proposed changes
4. **Monitor webhook integration** (if configured)
5. **Scale up** by adding more repositories

## Demo Checklist

1. Ensure `.env` contains valid Postgres/Redis URIs, Gemini key, GitHub App credentials, and webhook secret.
2. Start services (`make up` or manual processes) and run `make migrate`.
3. Expose the API via ngrok (`ngrok http 8000`) and set the GitHub App webhook URL accordingly.
4. Register a test repo (`POST /repos` or via the dashboard) and trigger a scan (`POST /scans`).
5. Monitor worker logs; once complete, view findings and PRs in the dashboard.
6. Confirm a branch + PR were created in GitHub.

The README files within `apps/api`, `apps/worker`, `apps/web`, and `infra` provide component-level testing/deployment notes.
